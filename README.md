#Purpose
This project was my answer to having forgotten the login password of a meditation app that I used at the time. Wanting to create a simple experience that gets right to the point, I set out to build an android app that I would enjoy using.

This was also a great deep dive with React-Native, Android development, and the Play Store publishing process.
